# Matiz fan speed control
some notes on how to control the fan speed in a chevrolet Matiz

## fan knob pinout
```
+----------+----------+----------+
| Speed 4- | Speed 2- | Speed 1- |
+----------+----------+----------+
| Speed 3- | On-      | 12V+     |
+----------+----------+----------+
           +----------+
```
Securing clip facing down

Connect on of the speed pins with 12V to regulate the speed
Off- is high when one of the speeds is selected

## ac and rear window heater
connect the 2 pins in a column to activate.

## heat control cable positions
0 = hottest
12 = coldest

level | position in mm
----- | --------
0 | 0
1 | 4
2 | 7
3 | 11
4 | 14
5 | 18
6 | 21
7 | 25
8 | 28
9 | 32
10 | 35
11 | 39
12 | 42

this comes down to 3,5 mm between each position.

## output control positions
this cable extends just as much as the cable for the heat control, but this time there are 5 positions.
So 42 mm / 4 = 10,5 mm between each position.
